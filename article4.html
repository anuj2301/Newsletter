                <h2>Anderson, Stokes, Atkinson leave WI in disarray after Smith's fifty on debut</h2>
                <p>Debutant Jamie Smith contributed with a half-century in a collective batting effort from England, which was followed by a clinical bowling performance led by James Anderson, Ben Stokes and Gus Atkinson as the hosts were charging towards a big victory in the opening Test against West Indies at Lord's. Having posted 371 in their first essay, England reduced West Indies to 79 for 6 at Stumps on Day 2 on Thursday (July 11), with the visitors still needing 171 runs to make England bat again.<br></p>
                 <p>Smith, who had just the tailenders with him, upped the ante after becoming the 10th England wicketkeeper to register a fifty-plus score on debut. He hit sixes off Shamar Joseph and Seales while Shoaib Bashir did well to survive at the other end until a direct hit from Louis found him short of the crease as he tried to get Smith back on strike. Smith then struck a four off Seales before handing a catch in the deep as England were bowled out late in the second session.<br></p>  
                 <p><b>Brief scores</b>: West Indies 121 & 79/6 (Alick Athanaze 22; James Anderson 2-11, Ben Stokes 2-25, Gus Atkinson 2-27) <br>trail England 371 (Zak Crawley 76, Jamie Smith 70, Joe Root 68, Ollie Pope 57, Harry Brook 50; Jayden Seales 4-77) by 250 runs.<br></p>
