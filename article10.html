                <h2>All you need to know about the Thirty Metre Telescope project involving India, US, Canada, Japan</h2>
                <p>India, the United States, Canada, China, and Japan are working on a major international project for studying space and the universe. Called the Thirty Metre Telescope (TMT), the project represents an ambitious international collaboration which aims to revolutionise the way we study space.

                    The TMT, with its enormous 30-meter primary mirror and advanced adaptive optics, will let scientists see cosmic objects in incredible detail, pushing the boundaries of our knowledge.<br>
                    Essentially, the Thirty Metre Telescope is a massive telescope designed to answer some of the most fundamental questions about the universe.

                    It will help us understand how the first galaxies and stars formed after the Big Bang, how galaxies evolve, the relationship between supermassive black holes and their host galaxies, the formation of stars and planetary systems, and even the characteristics of planets outside our solar system.
                    
                    The project initially aimed to build the telescope on Mauna Kea in Hawaii, a top spot for astronomy. However, this plan faced opposition from indigenous Hawaiians who see the site as sacred. Because of this, other locations like the Observatorio del Roque de los Muchachos in Spainâ€™s Canary Islands are also being considered.<br></p>
