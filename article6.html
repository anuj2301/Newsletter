                <h2>'What Signals Are We Sending?' : Supreme Court Expresses Shock At HC 'Casually' Staying Reasoned Bail Order For One Year</h2>
                <p>The Supreme Court of India on Thursday(July 11) expressed shock at the Delhi High Court staying a regular bail order without specifying any reasons.

                    The Court questioned the Directorate of Enforcement (ED) for defending the High Court's orders prolonging interim stay on a bail order by the trial court.
                    
                    During the hearing, Justice Abhay S Oka remarked, "When there is a reasoned order granting bail, can that order be casually stayed? Can it be merrily stayed for one year? What signals are we sending?"<br>
                    A bench of Justice Abhay S Oka and Justice Augustine George Masih was hearing a plea by one Parvinder Singh Khurana, an accused in a money laundering case, challenging Delhi High Court's order temporarily staying a bail order passed by the trial court.

                    The trial court had granted bail to the Khurana in June last year. ED sought cancellation of bail which is pending before the Delhi HC. The HC temporarily stayed the bail and continued the interim order from time to time.<br>
                    Senior Advocate Siddharth Luthra, appearing for Khurana, submitted that the High Court had not passed a reasoned order while staying the bail order. He submitted that the High Court had not even recorded the reasons for granting interim stay.<br>
                    The court reserved judgment in the matter while allowing Hossain to submit a short note within two days.<br>
